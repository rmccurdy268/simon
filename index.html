          <h3>A brief introduction to Simon:</h3>
          <p>Simon is our first major project in CS260 at BYU. As the semester goes on, we will add more and more technologies to this project to improve on it.
              The game itself is a very simple memory game. A pattern is demonstrated, and if you follow that pattern succesfully a new, longer sequence is demonstrated. 
              The points awarded are relative to the length of the last fully repeated sequence.
          </p>
